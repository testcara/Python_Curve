## 2. Small python project

Jira helper small package support the following requirement:

- It can be used as the cmd line tool
- Use the log module to log

During the review:
I also tried the following tools and usage with the reviewer' suggestion
- The sanity check tools:
-- black
-- flake8
-- pylint
- Some pythonic way:
-- return true_result if if_condition false_result
- The argparse module
- Then credential configuration for the project

I would keep on polishing the small python project with the following points:
- tox tool
- python decorator
- update the entrypoint script as the python script
- gitlab ci/cd for the python project
- exception
